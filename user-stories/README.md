# Airbnb Clone – User Stories Documentation

This directory contains the **user stories** derived from the Airbnb Clone Use Case Diagram.

## Objective

The goal of this task is to convert the interactions from the use case diagram into **user stories** that describe what each actor wants to achieve in the system.

Each story follows the format:

> **As a [type of user], I want to [goal], so that [reason].**

## Relation to Use Case Diagram

Every use case identified in the diagram has been rewritten here as a user story.  
- **Guest stories** cover booking, payments, reviews, and account management.  
- **Host stories** focus on property management and interaction with guests.  
- **Admin stories** describe platform oversight and maintenance tasks.

## Files Included

- `user-stories.md` → Contains the full list of user stories (Guest, Host, Admin).

## Outcome

These user stories help translate visual use case relationships into clear, actionable requirements for developers and stakeholders.
